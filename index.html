<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">JavaScript is a light-weight scripting language that can be executed in a web browser. It was designed by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It's initial purpose was to replace Java applets to make fast dynamic html pages. Since then it has grown in complexity and now can be executed on the server using node.js.
</div>

<p>According to wikipedia JavaScript is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm programming language. It has curly-bracket syntax similar to c and c++. It has dynamic typing and is prototype object orientation. Also JavaScript is a functional language, you can create first-class functions.</p>

<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.Using node.js you can create dynamic websites without using another back-end language.

<h2>Video Lecture</h2>

<p>If you have the bandwidth, watch the next video to learn about HTML and web pages. This video lecture is 10 min long, has no ads and is very informative for beginners. It was filmed by Sage-Code instructor in a Chicago garden in 2016 so you can hear children playing.I hope you will like it and post a comment.

<h4>Video Tutorial</h4>

<p>We have publish on YouTube recordings we have made from Twitch live stream. You can join us live every Friday at 1:00 PM for a new episode. Each episode will be published on YouTube after streaming. If you join for live session you can ask questions and we will answer live. Then your questions are going to be recorded. </p>


<h2><a id="js-bookmark">Learning JavaScript</a></h2>

<p>Next tutorial will describe JavaScript language in details. If you read one page every day you will finish learning in 9 days. We organize pages in logical order but sometimes you need to read them twice. For each page you should spend between 1 and 3 hours. Don't forget to take a break every hour or even more frequent. You can use next index to review each chapter. If you are first time here, please ignore the index and continue reading.

<h2>Running JavaScript</h2>

<p>You can run JavaScript code in your browser console for testing. You do not need a special IDE to run the examples presented in this tutorial. All you need is a browser that has support for JavaScript. I prefer to use Chrome and Firefox, so I will talk about these two. You can copy/paste JavaScript examples in the console window.
</p>

<p><b>How to run JavaScript in Mozilla Firefox:</b></p><p>Open a new tab in Firefox and in the URL bar enter about:blank to display a "blank tab" so that you can see what you are doing. From the Firefox menu select: Tools -&gt; Web Developer -&gt; Web Console. If your Firefox do not have menu you can press the hamburger button "â‰¡" then Web Developer->Web Console. If is hard to find try to use Ctrl+Shift+K or F12. A new Web Console window will open.</p>

</div>

<hr>

<p><b>How to run JavaScript in Chrome:</b></p><p>Open new tab in Chrome, select menu: &equiv; More Tools -&gt; Developer Tools -&gt; or press F12. Not all keyboards have F12 so you can press alternative hot key: Ctrl+Shift+J.This will opens the JavaScript console where you can write and test your code. When you open Developer Tools the page you are on is the current page opened in console. You have access to all objects in the page to debug (javascript) and investigate variables using "watch" tab.

<p><b>How to run JavaScript on <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a> website:</b></p>

<p>We are using repl.it website to store examples that you can open, study and run on-line. You do not need to install anything on your computer to learn JavaScript.We provide links for relevant examples that you can open using this platform.You can also create a free account and prototype code quickly for learning JavaScript.

<p><b>How to run JavaScript in NodeJS:</b></p>
<p>You can download NodeJS from here: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">download</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Open command prompt,</li>
<li>Change directory where your *.js examples are located,</li>
<li>Run command: like c:\program files\nodejs&gt;node hello.js.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notes:</h4>

<ul>
<li>We recommend to add "c:\program files\nodejs" to your $path so you can run node from your project folder.</li>
<li>Node.js has a command line interface console (CLI). It is a REPL application: Read Evaluate Print Loop.</li>
</ul>
